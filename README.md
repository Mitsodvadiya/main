This project entails the development of a comprehensive online compiler platform designed for users to tackle questions categorized by difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and hard.

Front end:
- Monako code editor has been harnessed for code editing purposes.
- @charaui/react has been employed for crafting stylish components.
- The project has harnessed buetiful-dnd for facilitating drag and drop functionalities.
- A tree data structure has been implemented for the creation of files and folders.
- Backend APIs have been seamlessly integrated for compilation tasks and data storage within MongoDB.
- An output panel has been established to showcase the resultant output.

Backend:
- The backend infrastructure has been constructed utilizing Node.js and Express technologies.
- APIs have been meticulously defined to handle CRUD operations on question models and to compile Motoko and Solidity code.
- The Solidity compilation API has made use of the 'solc' library.
- The codebase has been meticulously organized within a structured folder arrangement.
- This codebase stands independently and can be effortlessly integrated into diverse projects.

Note: The Solidity language compiler API delivers contracts exclusively. No other APIs or resources are currently accessible for incorporating Solidity within the prevailing market landscape.
- Acquiring proficiency in Solidity is imperative.
- Contracts can solely be generated utilizing the Solidity programming language.
- Upon inputting Solidity code, the API generates contracts.
- Should there be a preference for utilizing the Rust language, the repid API key can be utilized by altering the key to yield accurate outcomes.
